MiniWeb is a high-efficiency, cross-platform, small-footprint HTTP server implementation in C language. 
It implements GET and POST methods and works on multiple platforms ranging from server, desktop, game console and IoT hardware.
This document has the configuration setup and Powershell scripts to make this easy to use.

MiniWeb is an embeddable, cross-platform, small-footprint HTTP server implementation, implementing basic GET and POST requests as well as request handling dynamic content generating. It works on x86 (Windows/Linux), ARM, MIPS and any posix platforms, either embedded or standalone.

== Location

This project is located in the `x:\myCommands\MiniWeb` folder.

A copy of the one file required `miniweb.exe` is also in the `x:\myCommand` folder to allow it to be run from anywhere

== Features

* small footprint HTTP server written in pure C language
* 
* GET & POST actions with basic HTTP authentication
* easy-to-extend with URL handler callbacks
* cross-platform and scalable
* serial port access via HTTP
* integrated UDP server interacting with HTTP server

== Powershell anywhere

We might want to start this small HTTP server from any directory.
Putting the Miniweb.exe in a path would require you to pass the proper arguments to it as well.
This is not that simple.

If we create a Powershell script like `start-http.ps1` with the MiniWeb and arguments you woudl still have to type the path to the PS1 file.  This is better but, still not simple enough.

=== Profiles

You can create a Windows PowerShell profile and add the aliases, functions, and variables to the profiles. 
The profile is loaded every time that Windows PowerShell starts.

To load a profile, your Windows PowerShell execution policy must permit you to load configuration files. 
If it does not, the attempt to load the profile fails and Windows PowerShell displays an error message.

Where the hell did Microsoft put my profile for Powershell?

----
PS C:\myCommands\miniweb> $profile <1>
C:\Users\jschust2\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.VSCode_profile.ps1

<1> Type this in to display profile file name

Typically it is just an empty file.
